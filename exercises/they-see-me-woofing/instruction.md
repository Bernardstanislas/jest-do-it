# They see me woofing

Let's assume you wrote a function called `bark`, which takes a String and
adds a space and a `woof` to it. 
Write a test for that function.

The module exporting the `bark` function will be provided as a path through `process.argv[3]`.
You can import it writing `require(process.argv[3])`.
